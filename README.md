# upco_tools
Various python3 tools for editorial/post production needs

These are all under heavy development; added to as I come across new problems to solve in our pipeline

#### Incomplete but useable:
```
upco_ale.py       ALE reading and writing, plus conversion to Davinci Resolve CSVs
upco_timecode.py  Timecode conversion/math (no drop-frame support yet)
upco_ltfs.py      Parse schema files, find shots, mount/unmount tapes
upco_metadata.py  Weird wrapper for ffprobe which I intend to improve upon
```

#### Very incomplete:
```
upco_diva.py      Wrapper for Divascript win32 executable
upco_edl.py       EDL reading and writing; currently incomplete
```
